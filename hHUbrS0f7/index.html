<p>When a group of judges get together to decide a case, they vote on which side should win and also try to agree on a legal rationale to explain why that side has won.</p>
<p><strong>majority opinion</strong>-an opinion joined by the majority of judges on that court, mostly unanimously.</p>
<p><strong>concurring opinion / concurrence</strong>-explains a vote in favor of the winning side but based on a different legal rationale.</p>
<p><strong>dissenting opinion / dissent</strong>-explains a vote in favor of the losing side.</p>
<h1 id="结构">结构</h1>
<p><strong>Caption</strong>-the title of a case, usually tells who are the “parties” or “litigants”, for example, <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em>. In criminal law, the government is the named party, for example, <em>United States v. Doe.</em> if the federal government charges John Doe with a crime, and If a state brings the charges instead, the caption will be <em>State v. Doe / People v. Doe / Commonwealth v. Doe</em>, depending on the practices of that state.  English criminal cases normally will be <em>Rex v. Doe</em> or <em>Regina v. Doe</em>. Rex and Regina are Latin for “King” and “Queen” depending on who is in charge.</p>
<p><strong>Citation</strong>-letters and numbers below the case name, tells you the name of the court, the law book in which the opinion was published, and the year the court decided the case. For example, “U.S. Supreme Court, 485 U.S. 759 (1988)” refers to a U.S. Supreme Court case, decided in 1988, that appears in Volume 485 of the United States Reports, starting at page 759.</p>
<p><strong>Author</strong>-the name of the judge who wrote the opinion. Older cases often simply stated a last name followed by the initial “J.” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>On occasion, the opinion will use the Latin phrase “per curiam”[^per curiam] . It signals that the opinion reflects a common view among all the judges rather than the writings of a specific judge.</p>
<p>[^per curiam]: means “by the court”</p>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>-what happened. There are no particular rules for what facts must be included in this section, so sometimes it might seem vague or incomplete. Fact  in civil cases usually includes “procedural history” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>, like motions, hearings, and trials that occurred after the case was initially filed.</p>
<p><strong>Law</strong>-What’s the rule and how it applies. Many opinions present the law in two stages. The first discusses the general principles of law<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, and might explore the history of a particular law or “precedents.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>The second stage is the general legal principles to the particular facts of the dispute.</p>
<h1 id="词语">词语</h1>
<p>由于诺曼征服者使用法语，普通法有许多词汇是来自法语的。法律英语博大精深，这里仅简要介绍一些必须的词汇。</p>
<p>The word “common” in the “common law” means common in the sense of “shared by all,” not “not very special.” It is announced in judicial opinions, and used to refer to <strong>judge-made law opposed to legislatively-made law</strong>.</p>
<p>In a civil case, an award of money is “damages”; an order (not) to do something is an “injunction”; The person bringing the lawsuit is the “plaintiff” and the sued is the “defendant.”</p>
<p>In criminal cases, there is no plaintiff or lawsuit. Instead of filing a lawsuit and requesting for damages or injunction, the prosecutor<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> files criminal “charges” and asks the court to punish the individual by jail or fine.</p>
<p>In an appeal, the party filing the appeal is the “appellant.” The party defending the lower court’s decision is the “appellee”. Some courts label an appeal as a “petition,” and require the losing party to petition the higher court for relief. In these cases, the parties are “petitioner” and “respondent.”</p>
<p>When past courts have already answered similar questions before, a court may conclude it is bound by the past precedents, i.e. “stare decisis” meaning “That which has been already decided should remain settled.” In other settings, courts may justify their decisions on “public policy grounds”. That is, they may pick the rule and explain why that rule is best, particularly in common law cases where judges are not bound by a statute or constitutional rule.</p>
<p>The “disposition” of a case is the action the court took. At the very end of the opinion, an appeals court might (1) “affirm”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>, or (2) “reverse” a lower court decision Alternatively, an appeals court might (3) “vacate” the lower court decision, wiping the lower-court decision off the books, and then “remand” the case, sending it back to the lower court for further proceedings.</p>
<p>Some opinions resolve the parties’ legal dispute by announcing and applying <strong>a clear rule of law that is new to that particular case</strong>, i.e. the “holding” of the case. Holdings are often contrasted with “dicta” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>found in an opinion. Judges often reason by “analogy,” which means a new case may be governed by an older case when the facts are similar.</p>
<h1 id="理解重点">理解重点</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fact</li>
<li>Argument, 特别是framing<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup></li>
<li>Disposition</li>
<li>Reasoning: Source of Law, Methods of Reasoning<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup></li>
<li>Significance: Whether applies to other (hypothetical) situations</li>
<li>Concurrence/Dissent</li>
</ul>
<p>When a case is governed by a statute or already answered by previous court, the court usually will simply follow what the statute says. The court’s role is narrow in such settings because the legislature has settled the law.</p>
<h1 id="embrace-ambiguity">Embrace Ambiguity</h1>
<p>Sometimes a court won’t explain its reasoning very well, and you’ll look for the holding of the case but can’t find one. It’s not your fault; some opinions are written in a narrow way so that there is no clear holding, and others are just poorly reasoned or written.</p>
<p>One of the skills of topflight lawyers is that they know what they don’t know: they know when the law is unclear. Indeed, this skill of identifying when a problem is hard in the sense of being unsettled or unresolved by the courts.</p>
