<p>Subchapter B.</p>
<p>ISSUANCE OF SHARES</p>
<p>§ 6. 20. SUBSCRIPTION FOR SHRES BEFORE INCORPORATION</p>
<p>(a) A subscription for shares entered into before incorporation is irrevocable six months unless the subscription agreement provides a longer or shorter period or all the subscribers agree to revocation.</p>
<p>(b) The board of directors may determine the payment terms of subscription for shares that were entered into before incorporation, unless the subscription agreement specifies them. A call for payment by the board of directors must be uniform so far as practicable as to all shares of the same class or series, unless the subscription agreement specifies otherwise.</p>
<p>(c) Shares issued pursuant to subscriptions entered into before incorporation are fully paid and nonassessable when the corporation receives the consideration specified in the subscription agreement.</p>
<p>(d) If a subscriber defaults in payment of money or property under a subscription agreement entered into before incorporation, the corporation may collect the amount owed as any other debt. Alternatively, unless the subscription agreement provides otherwise, the corporation may rescind the corporation sends written demand for payment to the subscriber.</p>
<p>(e) A subscription agreement entered into after incorporation is a contract between the subscriber and the corporation subject to section 6.21.</p>
<p>§ 6.21. ISSUANCE OF SHARES</p>
<p>(a) The powers granted in this section to the board of directors may be reserved to the shareholders by the articles of incorporation.</p>
<p>(b) The board of directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed, or other securities of the corporation.</p>
<p>(c) Before the corporation issues shares, the board of directors must determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to be issued is adequate. That determination by the board of directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable.</p>
<p>(d) When the corporation receives the consideration for which the board of directors authorized the issuance of shares, the shares issued therefore are fully paid and nonassessable.</p>
<p>(e) The corporation may place in escrow shares issued for a contract for future services or benefits or a promissory note, or make other arrangements to restrict the transfer of the shares, and may credit distributions in respect of the shares against their purchase price, until the services are performed, the note is paid, or the benefits received. If the services are not performed, the note is not paid, or the benefits are not received, the shares escrowed or restricted and the distributions credited may be cancelled in whole or part.</p>
<p>(f) (1) An issuance of shares or other securities convertible into or rights exercisable for shares, in a transaction or a series of integrated transactions, requires approval of the shareholders, at a meeting at which a quorum consisting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter exists, if:</p>
<p>(i) the shares, other securities, or rights are issued for consideration other than cash or cash equivalents, and</p>
<p>(ii) the voting power of shares that are issued and issuable as a result of the transaction or series of integrated transactions will comprise more than 20 percent of the voting power of the shares of the corporation that were outstanding immediately before the transaction.</p>
<p>(2) In this subsection:</p>
<p>(i) For purpose of determining the voting power of shares issued and issuable as a result of a transaction or series of integrated transactions, the voting power of shares shall be the greater of (A) the voting power of the shares to be issued, or (B) the voting power of the shares that would be outstanding after giving effect to the conversion of convertible shares and other securities and the exercise of rights to be issued.</p>
<p>(ii) A series of transactions is integrated if consummation of one transaction is made contingent on consummation of one or more of the other transactions.</p>
<p>§ 6.22. LIABILITY OF SAHREHOLDERS</p>
<p>(a) A purchaser from a corporation of its own shares is not liable to the corporation or its creditors with respect to the shares except to pay the consideration for which the shares were authorized to be issued (section 6.21) or specified in the subscription agreement (section 6.20).</p>
<p>(b) Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, a shareholder of a corporation is not personally liable for the acts or debts of the corporation except that he may become personally liable by reason of his own acts or conduct.</p>
<p>§ 6.23. SHARE DIVIDENTS</p>
<p>(a) Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, shares may be issued pro rata and without consideration to the corporation’s shareholders or to the shareholders of one or more classes or series. An issuance of shares under this subsection is a share dividend.</p>
<p>(b) Shares of one class or series may not be issued as a share dividend in respect of shares of another class or series unless (1) the articles of incorporation so authorize, (2) a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the class or series to be issued approve the issue, or (3) there are no outstanding shares of the class or series to be issued.</p>
<p>(c) If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a share dividend, it is the date the board of directors authorizes the share dividend.</p>
<p>§ 6.24. SHARE OPTIONS</p>
<p>(a) A corporation may issue rights, options, or warrants for the purchase of shares or other securities of the corporation. The board of directors shall determine (i) the terms upon which the rights, options, or warrants are issued and (ii) the terms, including the consideration for which the shares or other securities are to be issued. The authorization by the board of directors for the corporation to issue such rights, options, or warrants constitutes authorization of the issuance of the shares or other securities for which the rights, options or warrants are exercisable.</p>
<p>(b) The terms and conditions of such rights, options or warrants, including those outstanding on the effective date of this section, may include, without limitation, restrictions or conditions that:</p>
<p>(1) preclude or limit the exercise, transfer or receipt of such rights, options or warrants by any person or persons owning or offering to acquire a specified number or percentage of the outstanding shares or other securities of the corporation or by any transferee or transferees of any such person or persons, or</p>
<p>(2) invalidate or void such rights, options or warrants held by any such person or persons or any such transferee or transferees.</p>
<p>§ 6.25. FORM AND CONTENT OF CERTIFICATES</p>
<p>(a) Shares may but need not be represented by certificates. Unless this Act or another statute expressly provides otherwise, the rights and obligations of shareholders are identical whether or not their shares are represented by certificates.</p>
<p>(b) At a minimum each share certificate must state on its face:</p>
<p>(1) the name of the issuing corporation and that it is organized under the law of this state;</p>
<p>(2) the name of the person to whom issued; and</p>
<p>(3) the number and class of shares and the designation of the series, if any, the certificate represents.</p>
<p>(c) If the issuing corporation is authorized to issue different classes of shares or different series within a class, the designations, relative rights, preferences, and limitations applicable to each class and the variations in rights, preferences, and limitations determined for each series (and the authority of the board of directors to determine variations for future series) must be summarized on the back that the corporation will furnish the shareholder this information on request in writing and without charge.</p>
<p>(d) Each share certificate (1) must be signed (either manually or in facsimile) by two officers designated in the bylaws or by the board of directors and (2) may bear the corporate seal or its facsimile.</p>
<p>(e) If the person who signed (either manually or in facsimile) a share certificate no longer holds office when the certificate is issued, the certificate is nevertheless valid.</p>
<p>§ 6.26. SHARES WITHOUR CERTIFICATES</p>
<p>(a) Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, the board of directors of a corporation may authorize the issue of some or all of the shares of any or all of its classes or series without certificates. The authorization does not affect shares already represented by certificates until they are surrendered to the corporation.</p>
<p>(b) Within a reasonable time after the issue or transfer of shares without certificates, the corporation shall send the shareholder a written statement of the information required on certificates by section 6.25(b) and (c), and, if applicable, section 6.27.</p>
<p>§ 6.27. RESTRICTION ON TRANSFER OF SHARE AND OTHER SECURITIES</p>
<p>(a) The articles of incorporation, bylaws, an agreement among shareholders, or an agreement between shareholders and the corporation may impose restrictions on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares of the corporation. A restriction does not affect shares issued before the restriction was adopted unless the holders of the shares are parties to the restriction agreement or voted in favour of the restriction.</p>
<p>(b) A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is valid and enforceable against the holder or a transferee of the holder if the restriction is authorized by this section and its existence is noted conspicuously on the front or back of the certificate or is contained in the information statement required by section 6.26(b). Unless so noted, a restriction is not enforceable against a person without knowledge of the restriction.</p>
<p>(c) A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is authorized:</p>
<p>(1) to maintain the corporation’s status when it is dependent on the number or identity of its shareholders;</p>
<p>(2) to preserve exemptions under federal or state securities law;</p>
<p>(3) for any other reasonable purpose.</p>
<p>(d) A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares may:</p>
<p>(1) obligate the shareholder first to offer the corporation or other persons (separately, consecutively, or simultaneously) an opportunity to acquire the restricted shares;</p>
<p>(2) obligate the corporation or other persons (separately, consecutively, or simultaneously) to acquire the restricted shares;</p>
<p>(3) require the corporation, the holders of any class of its shares, or another person to approve the transfer of the restricted shares, if the requirement is not manifestly unreasonable;</p>
<p>(4) prohibit the transfer of the restricted shares to designated persons or classes of persons, if the prohibition is not manifestly unreasonable.</p>
<p>(e) For purpose of this section, “shares” includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.</p>
<p>§ 6.28. EXPENSE OF ISSUE</p>
<p>A corporation may pay the expenses of selling or underwriting its shares, and of organizing or reorganizing the corporation, from the consideration received for shares.</p>
<p>Subchapter C.</p>
<p>SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION OF SHARES BY SHAREHOLDERS AND CORPORATION</p>
<p>§ 6.30. SHAREHOLDER’S PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS</p>
<p>(a) The shareholders of a corporation do not have a preemptive right to acquire the corporation’s unissued shares except to the extent the articles of incorporation so provide.</p>
<p>(b) A statement included in the articles of incorporation that “ the corporation elects to have preemptive rights” (or words of similar import) means that the following principles apply except to the extent the articles of incorporation expressly provide otherwise:</p>
<p>(1) The shareholders of the corporation have a preemptive right, granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board of directors to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right, to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation’s unissued shares upon the decision of the board of directors to issue them.</p>
<p>(2) A shareholder may waive his preemptive right. A waiver evidenced by a writing is irrevocable even though it is not supported by consideration.</p>
<p>(3) There is no preemptive right with respect to:</p>
<p>(i) shares issued as compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates;</p>
<p>(ii) shares issued to satisfy conversion or option rights created to provide compensation to directors, officers, agents, or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates;</p>
<p>(iii) shares authorized in articles of incorporation that are issued within six months from the effective date of incorporation;</p>
<p>(iv) shares sold otherwise than for money.</p>
<p>(4) Holders of shares of any class without general voting rights but with preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class.</p>
<p>(5) Holders of shares of any class with general voting rights but without preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class with preferential rights to distributions or assets unless the shares with preferential rights are convertible into or carry a right to subscribe for or acquire shares without preferential rights.</p>
<p>(6) Shares subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of one year after being offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board of directors that is no lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights. An offer at a lower consideration or after the expiration of one year is subject to the shareholders’ preemptive rights.</p>
<p>(7) For purposes of this section, “shares” includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.</p>
<p>§ 6.31. CORPORATION’S ACQUISITION OF ITS OWN SHARES</p>
<p>(a) A corporation may acquire its own shares, and shares so acquired constitute authorized but unissued shares.</p>
<p>(b) If the articles of incorporation prohibit the reissue of the acquired shares, the number of authorized shares is reduced by the number of shares acquired.</p>
<p>Subchapter D.</p>
<p>DISTRIBUTIONS</p>
<p>§ 6.40. DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS</p>
<p>(a) A board of directors may authorize and the corporation may make distributions to its shareholders subject to restriction by the articles of incorporation and the limitation in subsection (c).</p>
<p>(b) If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution (other than one involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation’s shares), it is the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution.</p>
<p>(c) No distribution may be made if, after giving it effect:</p>
<p>(1) the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or</p>
<p>(2) the corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.</p>
<p>(d) The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (c) either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
<p>(e) Except as provided in subsection (g), the effect of a distribution under subsection (c) is measured:</p>
<p>(1) in the case of distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation’s shares, as of the earlier of (i) the date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the corporation or (ii) the date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares;</p>
<p>(2) in the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is distributed; and</p>
<p>(3) in all other cases, as of (i) the date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization or (ii) the date the payment is made if it occurs more than 120 days after the date of authorization.</p>
<p>(f) A corporation’s indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation’s indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement.</p>
<p>(g) Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection (c) if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are made only of and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made.</p>
<p>(h) This section shall not apply to distributions in liquidation under chapter 14.</p>

<p>(a) A shareholder may vote his shares in person or by proxy.</p>
<p>(b) A shareholder or his agent or attorney-in-fact may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appointment form, or by an electronic transmission.

<p>(c) An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or an electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the inspector of election or the officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for 11 months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form.</p>
<p>(d) An appointment of a proxy is revocable unless the appointment form or electronic transmission states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with and interest. Appointments coupled with an interest include appointment of:</p>

<p>(4) an employee of the corporation whose employment contract requires the appointment; or</p>
<p>(5) a party to a voting agreement created under section 7.31.</p>

<p>§ 8.01. REQUIREMENT FOR AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS</p>
<p>(a) Except as provided in section 7.32, each corporation must have a board of directors.</p>
<p>(b) All corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the corporation managed by or under the direction of, its board of directors, subject to any limitation set forth in the articles of incorporation or in an agreement authorized under section 7.32.</p>
<p>§ 8.02. QUALIFICATIONS OF DIRECTORS</p>

<p>(a) A board of directors must consist of one or more individuals, with the number specified in or fixed in accordance with the articles of incorporation or bylaws.</p>
<p>(b) The number of directors may be increased or decreased from time to time by amendment to, or in the manner provided in, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws.</p>
<p>(c) Directors are elected at the first annual shareholders’ meeting and at each annual meeting thereafter unless their terms are staggered under section 8.06.</p>
<p>§ 8.04. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS BY CERTAIN CLASSES OF SHAREHOLDERS</p>
<p>If the articles of incorporation authorize dividing the shares into classes, the articles may also authorize the election of all or a specified number of directors by the holders of one or more authorized classes of shares. A class (or classes) of shares entitled to elect one or more directors is a separate voting group for purposes of the election of directors.</p>
<p>§ 8.05. TERMS OF DIRECTORS GENERALLY</p>
<p>(a) The terms of the initial directors of a corporation expire at the first shareholders’ meeting at which directors are elected.</p>

<p>§ 8.06. STAGGERED TERMS FOR DIRECTORS</p>
<p>The articles of incorporation may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into two or three groups, with each group containing one-half or one-third of the total, as near as may be. In that event, the terms of directors in the first group expire at the first annual shareholders’ meeting after their election, the terms of the second group expire at the second annual shareholders’ meeting after their election, and the terms of the third group, if any, expire at the third annual shareholders’ meeting after their election.

<p>(c) If cumulative voting is authorized, a director may not be removed if the number of votes sufficient to elect him under cumulative voting is voted against his removal. If cumulative voting is not authorized, a director may be removed only if the number of votes cast to remove him exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove him.</p>
<p>(d) A director may be removed by the shareholders only at a meeting called for the purpose of removing him and the meeting notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the director.</p>

<p>(a) The [name or describe] court of the county where a corporation’s principal office (or, if none in this state, its registered office) is located may remove a director of the corporation from office in a proceeding commenced by or in the right of the corporation if the court finds that (1) the director engaged in fraudulent conduct with respect to the corporation or its shareholders, grossly abused the position of director, or intentionally inflicted harm on the corporation; and (2) considering the director’s course of conduct and the inadequacy of other available remedies, removal would be in the best interest of the corporation.</p>
<p>(b) A shareholder proceeding on behalf of the corporation under subsection (a) shall comply with all of the requirements of sub-chapter 7D, except section 7.41(1).</p>
<p>(c) The court, in addition to removing the director, may bar the director from reelection for a period prescribed by the court.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in this section limits the equitable powers of the court to order other relief.</p>

<p>(b) If the vacant office was held by a director elected by a voting group of shareholders, only the holders of shares of that voting group are entitled to vote to fill the vacancy if it is filled by the shareholders.</p>
<p>(c) A vacancy that will occur at a specific later date (by reason of a resignation effective at a later date under section 8.07(b) or otherwise) may be filled before the vacancy occurs but the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs.</p>
<p>§ 8.11. COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS</p>

A director participating in a meeting by this means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.</p>
<p>§ 8.21. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING</p>
<p>(a) Except to the extent that the articles of incorporation or bylaws require that action by the board of directors be taken at a meeting, action required or permitted by this Act to be taken by the board of directors may be taken without a meeting if each director signs a consent describing the action to be taken and delivers it to the corporation.</p>
<p>(b) Action taken under this section is the act of the board of directors when one or more consents signed by all the directors are delivered to the corporation.

<p>(1) all its members are qualified directors, and</p>
<p>(2) its members are either all the qualified directors on the board or are appointed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the qualified directors on the board.</p>

<p>(c) A majority (but no fewer than two) of all the qualified directors on the board of directors, or on the committee, constitutes a quorum for purposes of action that complies with this section.

<p>(d) For purposes of this section, “qualified director” means, with respect to a director’s conflicting interest transaction, any director who does not have either (1) a conflicting interest respecting the transaction, or (2) a familial, financial, professional, or employment relationship with a second director who does have a conflicting interest respecting the transaction, which relationship would, in the circumstances, reasonably be expected to exert an influence on the first director’s judgment when voting on the transaction.</p>
<p>§ 8.63. SHAREHOLDERS’ ACTION</p>
<p>(a) Shareholder’ action respecting a transaction is effective for purposes of section 8.61(b)(2) if a majority of the votes entitled to be case by the holders of all qualified shares were cast in favour of the transaction after (1) notice to shareholders describing the director’s conflicting interest transaction, (2) provision of the information referred to in subsection (d), and (3) required disclosure to the shareholders who voted on the transaction (to the extent the information was not known by them).</p>
<p>(b) For purposes of this section, “qualified shares” means any shares entitled to vote with respect to the director’s conflicting interest transaction except shares that, to the knowledge, before the vote, of the secretary (or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes), are beneficially owned (or the voting of which is controlled) by a director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction or by a related person of the director, or both.</p>
<p>(c) A majority of the votes entitled to be case by the holders of all qualified shares constitutes a quorum for purposes of action that complies with this section. Subject to the provisions of subsections (d) and (e), shareholders’ action that otherwise complies with this section in not affected by the presence of holders, or the voting, of shares that are not qualified shares.</p>
<p>(d) For purposes of compliance with subsection (a), a director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction shall, before the shareholders’ vote, inform the secretary (or other office or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes) of the number, and the identity of persons holding or controlling the vote, of all shares that the director knows are beneficially owned (or the voting of which is controlled) by the director or by a related person of the director, or both.</p>
<p>(e) If a shareholders’ vote does not comply with subsection (a) solely because of a failure of a director to comply with subsection (d), and if the director establishes that his failure did not determine and was not intended by him to influence the outcome of the vote, the court may, with or without further proceedings respecting section 8.61(b)(3), take such action respecting the transaction and the director, and give such effect, if any, to the shareholders’ vote, as it considers appropriate in the circumstances.</p>

<p>In the case of a domestic corporation that is a party to a merger or share exchange:</p>

<p>(b) Except as provided in subsection (g) and in section 11.05, after adopting the plan of merger or share exchange the board of directors must submit the plan to the shareholders for their approval. The board of directors must also transmit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders approve the plan, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors must transmit to the shareholders the basis for that determination.</p>
<p>(c) The board of directors may condition its submission of the plan of merger or share exchange to the shareholders on any basis.</p>
<p>(d) If the plan of merger or share exchange is required to be approved by the shareholders, and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, the corporation must notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the plan is to be submitted for approval. The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. If the corporation is to be merged into an existing corporation or other entity, the notice shall also include or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the articles of incorporation or organizational documents of that corporation or other entity. If the corporation is to be merged into a corporation or other entity that is to be created pursuant to the merger, the notice shall include or be accompanied by a copy or a summary of the articles of incorporation or organizational documents of the new corporation or other entity.</p>
<p>(e) Unless the articles of incorporation, or the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection (c), requires a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange requires the approval of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum consisting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the plan exists, and, if any class or series of shares is entitled to vote as a separate group on the plan of merger or share exchange, the approval of each such separate voting group at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group consisting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the merger or share exchange by that voting group is present.</p>
<p>(f) Separate voting by voting groups is required:</p>
<p>(1) on a plan of merger, by each class or series of shares that:</p>
<p>(i) are to be converted under the plan of merger into other securities, interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or interests, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing; or</p>
<p>(ii) would be entitled to vote as a separate group on a provision in the plan that, if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of incorporation, would require action by separate voting groups under section 10.04;</p>
<p>(2) on a plan of share exchange, by each class or series of shares included in the exchange, with each class or series constituting a separate voting group; and</p>
<p>(3) on a plan of merger or share exchange, if the voting group is entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote as a voting group to approve a plan of merger or share exchange.</p>

<p>(1) the corporation will survive the merger or is the acquiring corporation in a share exchange;</p>
<p>(2) except for amendments permitted by section 10.05, its articles of incorporation will not be changed;</p>
<p>(3) each shareholder of the corporation whose shares were outstanding immediately before the effective date of the merger or share exchange will hold the same number of shares, with identical preferences, limitations, and relative rights, immediately after the effective date of change; and</p>
<p>(4) the issuance in the merger or share exchange of shares or other securities convertible into or rights exercisable for shares does not require a vote under section 6.21(f).</p>
<p>(h) If as a result of a merger or share exchange one or more shareholders of a domestic corporation would become subject to owner liability for the debts, obligations or liabilities of any other person or entity, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange shall require the execution, by each such shareholder, of a separate written consent to become subject to such owner liability.</p>

<p>(b) If under subsection (a) approval of a merger by the subsidiary’s shareholders is not required, the parent corporation shall, within ten days after the effective date of the merger, notify each of the subsidiary’s shareholders that the merger has become effective.</p>

Articles of merger or share exchange filed under this section may be combined with any filing required under the organic law of any domestic eligible entity involved in the transaction if the combined filing satisfies the requirements of both this section and the other organic law.</p>
<p>§ 11.07. EFFECT OF MERGER OR SHARE EXCHANGE</p>

<p>§ 12.02. SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF CERTAIN DISPOSITIONS</p>
<p>(a) A sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of assets, other than a disposition described in section 12.01, requires approval of the corporation’s shareholders if the disposition would leave the corporation without a significant continuing business activity. If a corporation retains a business activity that represented at least 25 percent of total assets at the end of the most recently completed fiscal year, and 25 percent of either income from continuing operations before taxes or revenues from continuing operations for that fiscal year, in each case of the corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, the corporation will conclusively be deemed to have retained a significant continuing business activity.</p>
<p>(b) A disposition that requires approval of the shareholders under subsection (a) shall be initiated by a resolution by the board of directors authorizing the disposition. After adoption of such a resolution, the board of directors shall submit the proposed disposition to the shareholders for their approval.

<p>(e) Unless the articles of incorporation or the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection (c) requires a greater vote, or a greater number of votes to be present, the approval of a disposition by the shareholders shall require the approval of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum consisting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be case on the disposition exists.</p>
<p>(f) After a disposition has been approved by the shareholders under subsection (b), and at any time before the disposition has been consummated, it may be abandoned by the corporation without action by the shareholders, subject to any contractual rights of other parties to the disposition.</p>
<p>(g) A disposition of assets in the course of dissolution under chapter 14 is not governed by this section.</p>

When two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of voting their shares of the corporation, each member of the group formed thereby shall be deemed to corporation beneficially owned by any member of the group.</p>

Such notice must be sent within ten days after the corporate became effective and include the materials described in section 13.22.</p>
<p>§ 13.21. NOTICE OF INTENT TO DEMAND PAYMENT</p>
<p>(a) If proposed corporate action requiring appraisal rights under section 13.02 is submitted to a vote at a shareholders’ meeting, a shareholder who wishes to assert appraisal rights with respect to any class or series of shares:</p>
<p>(1) must deliver to the corporation before the vote is taken written notice of the shareholder’s intent to demand payment if the proposed action is effectuated; and</p>
<p>(2) must not vote, or cause or permit to be voted, any shares of such class or series in favor of the proposed action.</p>
<p>(b) A shareholder who does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (a) is not entitled to payment under this chapter.</p>
<p>§ 13.22. APPRAISAL NOTICE AND FORM</p>
<p>(a) If proposed corporate action requiring appraisal rights under section 13.02(a) becomes effective, the corporation must deliver a written appraisal notice and form required by subsection (b)(1) to all shareholders who satisfied the requirements of section 13.21. In the case of a merger under section 11.05, the parent must deliver a written appraisal notice and form to all record shareholders who may be entitled to assert appraisal rights.</p>
<p>(b) The appraisal notice must be sent to earlier than the date the corporate action become effective and no later than ten days after such date and must:</p>
<p>(1) supply a form that specifies the date of the first announcement to shareholders of the principal terms of the proposed corporate action and requires the shareholder asserting appraisal rights to certify (i) whether or not beneficial ownership of those shares for which appraisal rights are asserted was acquired before that date and (ii) that the shareholder did not vote for the transaction;</p>
<p>(2) state:</p>
<p>(i) where the form must be sent and where certificates for certificated shares must be deposited and the date by which those certificates must be deposited, which date may not be earlier than the date for receiving the required form under subsection (2)(ii);</p>
<p>(ii) a date by which the corporation must receive the form which date may not be fewer than 40 nor more than 60 days after the date the subsection (a) appraisal notice and form are sent, and state that the shareholder shall have waived the right to demand appraisal with respect to the shares unless the form is received by the corporation by such specified date;</p>
<p>(iii) the corporation’s estimate of the fair value of the shares;</p>
<p>(iv) that, if requested in writing, the corporation will provide, to the shareholder so requesting, within ten days after the date specified in subsection (2)(ii) the number of shareholders who return the forms by the specified date and the total number of shares owned by them; and</p>

<p>(3) be accompanied by a copy of this chapter.</p>
<p>§ 13.23. PERFECTION OF RIGHTS; RIGHT TO WITHDRAW</p>
<p>(a) A shareholder who receives notice pursuant to section 13.22 and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must certify on the form sent by the corporation whether the beneficial owner of such shares acquired beneficial ownership of the shares before the date required to be set forth in the notice pursuant to section 13.22(b)(1). If a shareholder fails to make this certification, the corporation may elect to treat the shareholder’s shares as after-acquired shares under section 13.25.

A shareholder who fails to so withdraw from the appraisal process may not thereafter withdraw without the corporation’s written consent.</p>
<p>(c) A shareholder who does not execute and return the form and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit that shareholder’s share certificates where required, each by the date set forth in the notice described in section 13.22(b), shall not be entitled to payment under this chapter.</p>
<p>§ 13.24. PAYMENT</p>
<p>(a) Except as provided in section 13.25, within 30 days after the form required by section 13.22(b)(2)(ii) is due, the corporation shall pay in cash to those shareholders who complied with section 13.23(a) the amount the corporation estimates to be the fair value of their shares, plus interest.</p>
<p>(b) The payment to each shareholder pursuant to subsection (a) must be accompanied by:</p>
<p>(1) financial statements of the corporation that issued the shares to be appraised, consisting of a balance sheet as of the end of a fiscal year ending not more than 16 months before the date of payment, an income statement for that year, a statement of changes in shareholders’ equity for that year, and the latest available interim financial statements, if any;</p>
<p>(2) a statement of the corporation’s estimate of the fair value of the shares, which estimate must equal or exceed the corporation’s estimate given pursuant to section 13.22(b)(a)(iii);</p>
<p>(3) a statement that shareholders described in subsection (a) have the right to demand further payment under section 13.26 and that if any such shareholder does not do so within the time period specified therein, such shareholder shall be deemed to have accepted such payment in full satisfaction of the corporation’s obligations under this chapter.</p>
<p>§ 13.25. AFTER-ACQUIRED SHARES</p>
<p>(a) A corporation may elect to withhold payment required section 13.24 from any shareholder who did not certify that beneficial ownership of all of the shareholder’s shares for which appraisal rights are asserted was acquired before the date set forth in the appraisal notice sent pursuant to section 13.22(b)(1).</p>
<p>(b) If the corporation elected to withhold payment under subsection(a), it must, within 30 days after the form required by section 13.22(b)(2)(ii) is due, notify all shareholders who are described in subsection (a):</p>
<p>(1) of the information required by section 13.24(b)(1);</p>
<p>(2) of the corporation’s estimate of fair value pursuant to section 13.24(b)(2);</p>
<p>(3) that they may accept the corporation’s estimate of fair value, plus interest, in full satisfaction of their demands or demand appraisal under section 13.26;</p>
<p>(4) that those shareholders who wish to accept such offer must so notify the corporation of their acceptance of the corporation’s offer within 30 days after receiving the offer; and</p>
<p>(5) that those shareholders who do not satisfy the requirements for demanding appraisal under section 13.26 shall be deemed to have accepted the corporation’s offer.</p>
<p>(c) Within ten days after receiving the shareholder’s acceptance pursuant to subsection (b), the corporation must pay in cash the amount it offered under subsection (b)(2) to each shareholder who agreed to accept the corporation’s offer in full satisfaction of the shareholder’s demand.</p>
<p>(d) Within 40 days after sending the notice described in subsection (b), the corporation must pay in cash the amount it offered to pay under subsection (b)(2) to each shareholder described in subsection (b)(5).</p>
<p>§ 13.26. PROCEFURE IF SHAREHOLDER DISSATISFIED WITH PAYMENT OR OFFER</p>
<p>(a) A shareholder paid pursuant to section 13.24 who is dissatisfied with the amount of the payment must notify the corporation in writing of that shareholder’s estimate of the fair value of the shares and demand payment of that estimate plus interest (less any payment under section 13.24). A shareholder offered payment under section 13.25 who is dissatisfied with that offer must reject the offer and demand payment of the shareholder’s stated estimate of the fair value of the shares plus interest.</p>
<p>(b) A shareholder who fails to notify the corporation in writing of that shareholder’s demand to be paid the shareholder’s stated estimate of the fair value plus interest under subsection (a) within 30 days after receiving the corporation’s payment or offer of payment under section 13.24 or section 13.25, respectively, waives the right to demand payment under this section and shall be entitled only to the payment made or offered pursuant to those respective sections.</p>
<p>Subchapter C.</p>
<p>JUDICIAL APPRAISAL OF SHARES</p>
<p>§ 13.30. COURT ACTION</p>
<p>(a) If a shareholder makes demand for payment under section 13.26 which remains unsettled, the corporation shall commence a proceeding within 60 days after receiving the payment demand and petition the court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest. If the corporation does not commence the proceeding within the 60-day period, it shall pay in cash to each shareholder the amount the shareholder demanded pursuant to section 13.26 plus interest.</p>
<p>(b) The corporation shall commence the proceeding in the appropriate court of the county where the corporation’s principal office (or, if none, its registered office) in this state is located. If the corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in this state, it shall commence the proceeding in the county in this state where the principal office or registered office of the domestic corporation merged with the foreign corporation was located at the time of the transaction.</p>
<p>(c) The corporation shall make all shareholders (whether or not residents of this state) whose demands remain unsettled parties to the proceeding as in an action against their shares, and all parties must be served with a copy of the petition. Nonresidents may be served by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law.</p>
<p>(d) The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under subsection (b) is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The shareholders demanding appraisal rights are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings. There shall be no right to a jury trial.</p>
<p>(e) Each shareholder made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment (i) for the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of the shareholder’s shares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by the corporation to the shareholder for such shares or (ii) for the fair value, plus interest, of the shareholder’s shares for which the corporation elected to withhold payment under section 13.25.</p>
<p>§ 13.31. COURT COSTS AND COUNSEL FEES</p>
<p>(a) The court in an appraisal proceeding commenced under section 13.30 shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court. The court shall assess the costs against the corporation, except that the court may assess costs against all or some of the shareholders demanding appraisal, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds such shareholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this chapter.</p>
<p>(b) The court in an appraisal proceeding may also assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable:</p>
<p>(1) against the corporation and in favor of any or all shareholders demanding appraisal if the court finds the corporation did not substantially comply with the requirements of sections 13.20, 13.22, 13.24 or 13.25; or</p>
<p>(2) against either the corporation or a shareholder demanding appraisal, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this chapter.</p>
<p>(c) If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the services of counsel for any shareholder were of substantial benefit to other shareholders similarly situated, and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may award to such counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded the shareholders who were benefited.</p>
<p>(d) To the extent the corporation fails to make a required payment pursuant to sections 13.24, 13.25, or 13.26, the shareholder may sue directly for the amount owed and, to the extent successful, shall be entitled to recover from the corporation all costs and expenses of the suit, including counsel fees.</p>

<p>(e) Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, where necessary in the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional costs, fees, and expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among them.</p>

<p>§ 15.30. GROUNDS FOR REVOCATION</p>
<p>The secretary of state may commence a proceeding under section 15.31 to revoke the certificate of authority of a foreign corporation authorized to transact business in this state if:</p>
<p>(1) the foreign corporation does not deliver its annual report to the secretary of state within 60 days after it is due;</p>
<p>(2) the foreign corporation does not pay within 60 days after they are due any franchise taxes or penalties imposed by this Act or other law;</p>
<p>(3) the foreign corporation is without a registered agent or registered office in this state for 60 days or more;</p>
<p>(4) the foreign corporation does not inform the secretary of state under section 15.08 or 15.09 that its registered agent or registered office has changed, that its registered agent has resigned, or that its registered office has been discontinued within 60 days of the change, resignation, or discontinuance;</p>
<p>(5) an incorporator, director, officer, or agent of the foreign corporation signed a document he knew was false in any material respect with intent that the document be delivered to the secretary of state for filing;</p>
<p>(6) the secretary of state receives a duly authenticated certificate from the secretary of state or other official having custody of corporate records in the state or country under whose law the foreign corporation is incorporated stating that it has been dissolved or disappeared as the result of a merger.</p>
<p>§ 15.31. PROCEDURE FOR AND EFFECT OF REVOCATION</p>
<p>(a) If the secretary of state determines that one or more grounds exist under section 15.30 for revocation of a certificate of authority, he shall serve the foreign corporation with written notice of his determination under section 15.10.</p>
<p>(b) If the foreign corporation does not correct each ground for revocation or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the secretary of state that each ground determined by the secretary of state does not exist within 60 days after service of the notice is perfected under section 15.10, the secretary of state may revoke the foreign corporation’s certificate of authority by signing a certificate of revocation that recites the ground or grounds for revocation and its effective date. The secretary of state shall file the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the foreign corporation under section 15.10.</p>
<p>(c) The authority of a foreign corporation to transact business in this state ceases on the date shown on the certificate revoking its certificate of authority.</p>
<p>(d) The secretary of state’s revocation of a foreign corporation’s certificate of authority appoints the secretary of state the foreign corporation’s agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cause of action which arose during the time the foreign corporation was authorized to transact business in this state. Service of process on the secretary of state under this subsection is service on the foreign corporation. Upon receipt of process, the secretary of state shall mail a copy of the process to the secretary of the foreign corporation at its principal office shown in its most recent annual report or in any subsequent communication received from the corporation stating the current mailing address of its principal office, or, if none are on file, in its application for a certificate of authority.</p>
<p>(e) Revocation of a foreign corporation’s certificate of authority does not terminate the authority of the registered agent of the corporation.</p>
<p>§ 15.32. APPEAL FROM REVOCATION</p>
<p>(a) A foreign corporation may appeal the secretary of state’s revocation of its certificate of authority to the [name or describe] court within 30 days after service of the certificate of revocation is perfected under section 15.10. The foreign corporation appeals by petitioning the court to set aside the revocation and attaching to the petition copies of its certificate of authority and the secretary of state’s certificate of revocation.</p>
<p>(b) The court may summarily order the secretary of state to reinstate the certificate of authority or may take any other action the court considers appropriate.</p>
<p>(c) The court’s final decision may be appealed as in other civil proceedings.</p>
